This plugin allows you to configure automatic relationships between users from an external database.  

Users familiar with enrol/db should have no problems configuring this.

Plugin has been tested on 2.3.

This plugin was first developed by Penny Leach <penny@catalyst.net.nz> for Moodle 1.9
by I modified it to work with Moodle 2.3

This is my first experience with Moodle plugin development, so your comments are more than
welcome. Useless to say that you use this piece of code at your own risk :)
